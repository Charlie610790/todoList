To Do List
========

To do list using Backbone JS

This was my first attempt using Backbone JS.  Using models, collections, and views to setup the page without routers.  This is a to do list that lets the user add new chores to the list and remove completed tasks or marked them as completed. 

Tools Used:<BR>
Backbone, SASS, HTML, CSS<BR>

Below is a screen shot of the page designed.<BR>
